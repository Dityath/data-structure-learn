# Week 2
## Pointer

The pdf file is the main assigment from lms, and the rest is cpp file that I use to learn how the algorithm works. You can try this cpp file by copying it manually or clone it (but i dont know how to clone directly to the codeblocks lol, im not using codeblocks)

*note: in the cpp file, it seems like cpp cant print the value of null, the null value from the pointer always terminate the program with exit code 139. So, I manually use string of "null" instead print the pointer directly.
