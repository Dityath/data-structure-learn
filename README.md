# data-structure-learn

Set of my Data Structure assignment

The preliminary task is named by a folder whose first name has the name "TP".
For example: [tp_1_std](https://github.com/Dityath/data-structure-learn/tree/main/tp_1_std), while the asssignment folder is list of data structure assignments from 1st week

It's okay to copy but don't forget to paraphrase it ;)
